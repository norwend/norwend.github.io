**Учтите, что это полный гайд по прохождению игры на 100%!** Вам нужен этот гайд, если вы хотите пройти *Robotics;Notes ELITE* <ins>**И**</ins> получить все ачивки. Если вы хотите просто пройти игру, ничего не упустив, то вам нужен гайд по рутам, который можно найти [здесь]().

---
# **Предисловие**

*Robotics;Notes ELITE* весьма запутана в плане прохождения и получения всех ачивок – больше других визуальных новелл в серии **Science Adventure.** В игре используется целая комбинация различных триггеров, объединённых в "Триггеры PhoneDroid". Туда входят:

- геотэги в приложении "IRUO."
- схватки в "Kill-Ballad"
- перемещения по карте с помощью "Deluoode Map"
- ответы на твипы через "Twipo"

Некоторые плохие концовки можно получить только через Kill-Ballad, но, в основном, весь выбор рутов и концовок зависит от выборов в Twipo.

В новелле главы называются фазами. Проходить вслепую строго не рекомендуется, поскольку так можно упустить много контента и попасть на фазу 08, миновав фазы 06 и 07. Этот гайд поможет вам пошагово пройти новеллу, ничего не упустив, а также проведёт вас по рутам в правильном порядке прохождения и позволит получить все ачивки в стиме.

**<u>ВАЖНО:</u>** если у вас установлен [патч от Committee of Zero]() (который *крайне* рекомендован к установке, поскольку правит огромное количество ошибок перевода, опечаток, добавляет поддержку мыши и улучшает отображение шрифта), то вам нужен **[этот гайд]()**. Он написан с учётом внесённых правок и соответствует текстам в патче.

**Ну а теперь погнали! Шторм и буря! Взрывная волна! Ганваррель! *JYAKIIIIIN!***

## Условные обозначения

Для удобства, в этом гайде игровые триггеры отмечены разными способами. Например, геотэги будут выглядеть так:

> *GEOTAG № XXX: Steins Gate*

А твипы будут отображаться по-другому:

> **NEIDHARDT: Whose eyes are those eyes?**
>
> Ответ: Those eyes are god's eyes

------



# **ФАЗА 1**

## **6.10.2019 - Понедельник**

Исход первой схватки в **Kill-Ballad** (KB) ни на что не влияет, за исключением реакции главного героя на проигрыш/выигрыш. Иконки в обучающем баннере взяты с версии игры на Playstation, но в ПК-версии в самой Kill-Ballad используются клавиши WASD. Иконки в обучении отобразятся правильно, если вы играете на консоли, либо с геймпадом на ПК.

После окончания схватки, как только игра даст вам доступ к PhoneDroid (на экране будет сцена с Акихо), откройте **IRUO.** на **PokeCom.** Затем найдите следующие **геотэги**:

> - *GEOTAG № 072: Robot Research Club*
> - *GEOTAG № 073: Soccer Club Equipment Storage*
> - *GEOTAG № 074: Volunteer Group*
> - *GEOTAG № 075: Surf Group Equipment Storage*
> - *GEOTAG № 001: Akiho Senomiya*

Затем откройте приложение **Twipo** и ответьте на твипы в следующем порядке:

> **AKIPOPOPOOON: Because he was a spoiled brat**
>
> Ответ: Was that the Red Comet?

> **AKIPOPOPOOON Gonna go to tea time with Yamada from Japanese class**
>
> Ответ: Yamada is a nice guy

> **AKIPOPOPOOON Vice Principal didn’t come. Didn’t see her again…**
>
> Ответ: Maybe send a letter?

> **AKIPOPOPOOON @UMISHO You at the club room?**
>
> Ответ: I am

> **AKIPOPOPOON Gonna go to the club room! Storm and Stress! Energy Explosion!!!**
>
> Ответ: I can see you really screaming

Позже в школе у вас будет схватка с Акихо в **Kill-Ballad**. Её ник в **KB**– **AKI-PO**. После этого, вечером, вам нужно будет ответить на ещё один твип от Акихо:

> **AKIPOPOPOOON Is This Youth?**
>
> Ответ: If it’s KB I can pull an all-nighter

Спустя какое-то время, вы окажетесь на заброшенном аэропорту Танегашимы. Оказавшись в ангаре, откройте **IRUO.** и получите ещё один геотэг:

> *GEOTAG № 052: Gunvarrel Prototype Model-1 Lower Half*

Снаружи ангара можно найти ещё два геотэга, получаемых автоматически в процессе игры:

> *GEOTAG No. 084: Central Tanegashima High Robot Club Hangar*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 085: Central Tanegashima High Robot Club Equipment*
>
> *Automatic Story Geotag: GEOTAG No. 114: Lonsow Minamitane-cho Branch*

Оказавшись у терминала аэропорта, вас будет ждать ещё четыре геотэга:

> *GEOTAG No: 086: Old Tanegashima Airport Terminal*
>
> *GEOTAG No: 087: From Airport Administration Office*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 055: MI361X*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 054: MA808X*

## **6.11.2019 – Вторник**

Вы попадёте в **магазинчик Ирей** (*Irei General Store*), где, находясь снаружи, вам нужно будет открыть ещё два геотэга и ответить на твип:

> *GEOTAG No. 104: Irei General Store*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 105: Beverage Corner*

> **AKIPOPOPOOON Started watching Faibird again and got hooked and watched 10 eps. Look at the time!**
>
> Ответ: I told you not to stay up late. Gotta follow that rule

Внутри магазина будут ещё пять геотэгов:

> *GEOTAG No. 007: HUG HUGR-03 HAYATE*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 109: Brand New! Passion Fruit Bun!*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 108: Benny-chan Card*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 106: Skal White*
>
> *GEOTAG No. 107: Fruit Sour Melon*

Находясь на лужайке у кружка возле школы, ответьте на твип Акихо:

> **AKIPOPOPOOON: OHNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
>
> Ответ: Forget the club room key?

Reply: It’s uncommon to cry due to frustration, which means you took it really seriously. You still think it was a forced habit?

**AKIPOPOPOPOOON Can’t find it. Stolen? No, that’s not possible. It’s broken. Basically no one knows the real identity of Pleiades. I don’t want to think that people on the island stole it. But it is the winning machine…there might be people who would buy it**

Later on, at Kaito’s house at night, make sure to reply to these tweeps.

**FRAUKOUJIRO Do you like high school girls (NEETs) that have trashy rooms? I still don’t know how to take out the trash. I mean when is a butler with Four Eyes Butler gonna knock on my door? Hurry up, can’t control what’ll happen!**
Reply: Hey, I try to clean up what trash I can whenever I visit. When do I get paid for it?

Reply: Yup that’s it!

**DAITOKU_JUNJUN My role keeps getting bigger and bigger. I’m really afraid that I shouldn’t be allowed to be here… People all around me are so talented. I couldn’t keep up yesterday either**
Reply: You should learn from Frau Koujiro. I think that’ll help you out. Let’s be bold.

**FRAUKOUJIRO Oof, I feel dizzy. It must be because I was pulled out of my room for a long time yesterday. The sunlight is poison to shut-in, SMH**
Reply: U k? Please don’t be like suddenly dead. That’d suck

## 8.01.2019 Thursday

On this day, in Kaito’s room, reply to the following tweep by Frau.

**FRAUKOUJIRO The hallway is soaked in water. Some of the windows shattered too. Gotta say the place is ruined. Wallet’s gonna get cold from all the repairs**

## 8.02.2019 Friday

This day has more scattered interactions, the first one will be on the Old Tanegashima Airport Runway.

Reply: Good luck~

And later on, in the evening, make sure to reply to Junna’s tweep before you finish off Phase 04.

**DAITOKU_JUNJUN Today, I was no help. The absolute worst. I ran away, even though I was chosen… I’d lost the fight before it began. I tormented myself to not think about it. I kept on ignoring all the disappointed, pitiful feelings and repeated myself over and over**

# PHASE 5

## 8.13.2019 Tuesday

## 8.18.2019 Sunday

There are quite a few tweeps to reply to on this day, although they’re all conveniently nested together at the Old Tanegashima Airport.

**AKIPOPOPOPOOON I want them to stop saying that it’s Big Sis’s fault. That was an accident, and no one at Exske was intending to do that. But they still air those words to the public. It’s so harsh. Makes them look bad…**
Reply: If you stay on Misa-ne’s side, it will be fine.

*GEOTAG No. 110: Tanegashima Central Hospital*

After this, reply to Akiho’s tweep and NO others:

**AKIPOPOPOPOOON Uncle Kanade may look intense, but really he’s just annoying. But it may only be when he talks to me… Yeah, I get that my requests don’t make much money, but he doesn’t have to point it out!**
Reply: Did you complain about the inferior goods you were given? You need to speak up for yourself

**Make a save here. This will be referred to as Save 01 in the future. For future reference, make sure to lock the save.**

Getting the location of the report wrong 10 times will net you a trophy/achievement.

For that, you could go with the following order:
\1. The Robot Clinic
\2. Tanegashima Central Hospital (again)
\3. Hase Park
…and repeat, since these are right next to each other.

The geotag will finally be located at Hamada Swimming Beach.

Open up IRUO. and move above the Chikura Cavern tag, and there should be a faint power-sign there

*GEOTAG No. 067: Kimijima Report No. 3.*

## 8.27.2019 Tuesday

**AKIPOPOPOPOOON Shocked about Gunvarrel. 2 days and I’m still not over it. I guess more than shocked, I am dissapointed. I get all heated thinking about the last episode. I guess I liked Gunvarrel that much**

Reply: Rather than being mad at me ditching, you should compliment Jun-chan’s progress

After this, open IRUO. and select the power mark dead-center on the upper part of the Torii (Shrine Gate).

## 1.29.2020 Wednesday

This day only has events at the Old Tanegashima Airport Hangar.
**Make a new save point here. Make sure to lock it. This save will be referred to as Save 02 from now on.** 

The only thing to worry about is a Kill-Ballad battle with Akiho, which decides if you get the phase’s bad ending or progress forward to Phase 10. Make sure to win to reach Phase 09’s Bad Ending, which nets you an achievement/trophy.

##### PHASE 9 - BAD ENDING

Load Save 02, and instead lose to Akiho to progress to Phase 10



# PHASE 10

## 2.19.2020 Wednesday

The only thing to worry about in this phase trigger-wise is in front of Tokyo Expo Odaiba Arena AQUA, where Akiho has a tweep for you to reply to:

**AKIPOPOPOPOOON A little worried all by myself. Makes me think they might not come back…**
Reply: I’m already in Odaiba. Don’t worry



# PHASE 11

## 2.26.2020 Monday

At the JAXA Chofu Space Center, immediately after Airi appears, open IRUO. for an additional geotag. This is the only thing to worry about in this phase.

*GEOTAG No. 004: Airi Yukifune*



# PHASE 12

## 2.27.2020 Thursday

At the Old Tanegashima Airport Hangar, reply to Junna and Mr Pleiades’ tweeps.

**Mr_PLEIADES @AKIPOPOPOPOOON @UMISHO Now is not the time for that! Don’t worry about nonsense!**
Reply: Looks like you grew up a bit, S-kun

**DAITOKU_JUNJUN I’ll try! Hidaka-kun forgave me! I’ll be Hidaka-kun’s legs! I have confidence in my stamina!**
Reply: Let’s see the real you

Afterwards, in the classroom, make sure to get the usual geotag.

*GEOTAG No. 030: Today’s Chore Duty*

## 2.28.2020 Friday

At the Old Tanegashima Airport Hangar, make sure to reply to Akiho’s tweep.

**AKIPOPOPOPOOON You need to just rest, Kai! Your time will come later. Stay in the best condition you can, don’t lest everybody’s hrd work go to waste. Counting on you**
Reply: Right, I know

**Before the final fight, make a new save. This will be referred to as Save 03.**

Make sure to lose to SUMERAGI by entering one wrong button input to reach Phase 12’s bad end.

##### PHASE 12 - BAD ENDING

Then, reload Save 03 and win against both SUMERAGI and KAMINAGI. All commands must be done correctly. Failing will result in you instantly getting the bad end.

##### PHASE 12 - AKIHO ENDING

Theoretically, there shouldn’t be any leftovers at this point, but if there are, please let us know and we’ll update the guide with any missing info. Nocchi-yo!

## Paragraph

I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
